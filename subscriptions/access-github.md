# Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions

Customers who have Enterprise Agreements (EA) with Microsoft are eligible to purchase a new subscription offer that brings together Visual Studio standard subscriptions and GitHub Enterprise. It's an easy and economical way for Visual Studio subscribers to acquire GitHub Enterprise. 

- Innovate at scale with Visual Studio and GitHub by securely bringing open source code, community and best practices into your IDE and workflows.
- Use best-in-class development tools and services for developers with the most comprehensive set of resources to create, deploy and manage great applications. 
- Collaborate, manage pull requests on GitHub Enterprise and review source code where it was written - in the editor. 

## What's available? 

The following options are available:

- Visual Studio Enterprise with GitHub Enterprise
- Visual Studio Professional with GitHub Enterprise

Visual Studio Enterprise, Visual Studio Professional, and GitHub Enterprise will also continue to be available separately. 

To learn more about benefits and options please visit <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/subscriptions/visual-studio-github>. 

## What is the Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise setup process?

Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are managed in two parts:
1. The Visual Studio subscription (Enterprise or Professional)
2. GitHub Enterprise 

When you are assigned a Visual Studio with GitHub subscription, you'll receive an email letting you know that your Visual Studio subscriptions administrator has assigned a subscription to you.  At that point, you will be able to view available subscription benefits at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>.  This includes the GitHub Enterprise benefit as seen below.

   > ![GitHub Enterprise pending Enterprise account setup](_img/access-github/pending-account-setup.png "Your organization must first set up an Enterprise account.")  

GitHub Enterprise is managed by a GitHub administrator separately from Visual Studio subscriptions.  When your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, you will receive an email from GitHub notifying you that your Visual Studio subscription has been linked and the benefit tile will be updated as seen below.  Setting up this account may take some time and is dependent on your company completing the setup process. After you receive the email, you can reach out to the appropriate GitHub organization administrator to request an invitation to their organization and/or repo.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![GitHub Enterprise pending GitHub invitation](_img/access-github/pending-invite.png "Contact your GitHub administrator to request invitation to a GitHub organization.")  

When an invitation is sent by your GitHub organization administrator, you will receive an email from GitHub and the benefit tile will update again:

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![GitHub Enterprise pending invitation acceptance](_img/access-github/pending-acceptance.png "Accept the invitation you receive in the email from GitHub")  

After you accept the GitHub organization invitation the status shown on the tile will change from "Pending" to "Activated".

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![GitHub Enterprise activated](_img/access-github/activated.png "Upon acceptance of the invitation, the tile will indicate that your subscription has been activated.")

## Frequently asked questions

### Q:  Where is my GitHub subscription?
A:  The process for setting up a GitHub Enterprise account can take a while.  If you've been waiting and haven't heard anything, you may want to reach out to your GitHub administrator.  It's possible that your administrator is still working on it or has elected not to create a GitHub Enterprise account. 

### Q: Do I get the full Visual Studio subscription benefits?
A:  Along with GitHub Enterprise, you receive all of the benefits of a standard Visual Studio subscription including software downloads, cloud services, technical support and partner benefits just as you would if the subscription was purchased separately.

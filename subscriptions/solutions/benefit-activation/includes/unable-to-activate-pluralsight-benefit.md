## I'm unable to activate my Pluralsight benefit.

Depending on which Visual Studio subscription or program membership you have, you may be eligible for up to six months of free access to Pluralsight.  

## How to activate 
1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and click on the Activate link on the Pluralsight benefit tile located in the Professional Development section on the Benefits page. 
1. You'll be redirected to complete the Pluralsight subscription sign up form for the benefit level that's included with your Visual Studio subscription. Note:
this registration page expires after a few minutes. If you don't complete the registration process before the page expires, return to step 1. 
1. You will see a confirmation on the page and be asked to set a password. 
1. After you activate your Pluralsight benefit, the appearance of the tile in the Visual Studio subscriptions portal will change to help you track the status of your subscription. You may need to refresh the portal to see this.

## How to become a super admin for Visual Studio subscriptions agreements managed by partners

Organizations who purchase Visual Studio subscriptions through Volume Licensing use administrators and super admins to manage subscriptions.  Only super admins can assign administrative rights to users.  To become an administrator or super admin, contact a super admin in your organization.  If there are no super admins in your organization and you purchase your subscriptions through a partner or reseller, contact your partner/reseller for assistance with appointing at least one super admin.  It is recommended that every agreement have at least two super admins at all times.  

If you already have a subscription assigned, sign in to https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions and click **Contact my Admin**.  More infomration is available in our [Contact my Admin](contact-my-admin.md) article.

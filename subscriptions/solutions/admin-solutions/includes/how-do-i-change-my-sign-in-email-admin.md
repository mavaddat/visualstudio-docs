## How to change sign-in emails for admins and super admins

Changing sign-in addresses for admins and super admins requires removing the individual and then adding them as an admin or super admin using the desired new email address. 

If you are a super admin, you can create new admins and super admins.  To change your own sign-in address:
1. Sign in to the Administration Portal at [https://manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com)
0. Click **Add**.
0. Enter your name 
0. Enter the email address you wish to use to sign in.
0. Click the **Super admin** checkbox.
0. Click **Save**.
0. Select the entry in the list of admins that shows your old sign-in email address.
0. Click the **"..."** and choose **Delete** or click **Delete** on the menu at the top of the list.
0. Click **Confirm**.

Changing the sign-in email address for others is as simple as following the steps above and substituting their information in steps 3 and 4.  If you do not wish to make them a super admin, skip step 5.

If you are an administrator (but not a super admin), you will need to contact a super admin to change your sign-in email address.  Super admins on your agreement are denoted by the green checkmark in the Super admin column in the Administrators list.

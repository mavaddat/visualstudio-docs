## How do I use my benefits?

Just as the types of benefits vary, so do the methods for activating and using them. For example, many of our benefits are provided by partners and the processes for setting up accounts, installing software, and using online resources vary widely.

For each benefit available in the Subscriber Portal, we've provided articles that include information such as which subscriptions include them, as well as steps to activate the benefits.

Check out our documentation to [learn more](../../../../whats-new-in-subscriptions.md) (click on 'Subscriptions' in the left nav pane, and choose 'Benefits').

## What is the Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise setup process? 

Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are managed in two parts:  
- The Visual Studio subscription (Enterprise or Professional)  
- GitHub Enterprise  

When you are assigned a Visual Studio with GitHub subscription, you'll receive an email letting you know that your Visual Studio Subscriptions administrator has assigned a subscription to you. At that point, you are able to view available subscription benefits at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>. This includes the GitHub Enterprise benefit. 

GitHub Enterprise is managed by a GitHub administrator, separately from Visual Studio subscriptions. When your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, you will receive an email from GitHub notifying you that your Visual Studio subscription has been linked and the benefit tile will update. Setting up this account may take some time and is dependent on your company completing the setup process. After you receive the email, you can reach out to the appropriate GitHub organization administrator to request an invitation to their organization and/or repo. 

When an invitation is sent from your GitHub org administrator, you will receive an email from GitHub and the benefit tile will update again. 

After you accept the GitHub org invitation, the appearance of the benefit tile at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits> will change from “Pending” to “Activated” and you can now start using GitHub Enterprise.

## How do I renew my subscriptions?

The process for renewing subscriptions depends on how they were purchased.

Retail: For subscriptions acquired through the Microsoft Store, connect to the Microsoft Store's [business software](https://www.microsoft.com/store/b/software?icid=Cnav_software_businesssoftware&activetab=pivot1%3arichpivot1-1) section, and scroll down to the Visual Studio section to see the available subscriptions. Be sure to select the renewal subscription level and [activate it here](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/activate).

Cloud subscriptions: If you're using cloud subscriptions, you don't need to renew them. They renew automatically until you cancel them.

Learn more about [buying cloud subscriptions](../../../../vscloud-overview.md).

Volume Licensing: To renew subscriptions purchased through Volume Licensing, please contact your reseller. [Find a reseller](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/how-to-buy/how-to-buy) in your area.

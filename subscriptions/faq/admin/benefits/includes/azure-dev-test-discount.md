## How do my developers get 50% off Azure Dev/Test workloads?

If your organization has an Enterprise Agreement for Azure, your developers can choose between the $50-$150 Azure credits or 50% off Dev/Test pricing. They cannot use both on the same subscription. For details on how to enable the Dev/Test pricing option for your developers, check out the video [Help your subscribers get the most out of Azure](https://aka.ms/HelpingSubscriberswithAzure).

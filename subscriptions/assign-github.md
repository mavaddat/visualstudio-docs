# Manage Visual Studio subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise
Customers who have Enterprise Agreements (EA) with Microsoft are eligible to purchase a new subscription offer that brings together Visual Studio standard subscriptions and GitHub Enterprise. It's the easy and economical way for Visual Studio subscribers to acquire GitHub Enterprise. 

When your organization purchases Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, they are provisioned and managed in two parts.

## Manage Visual Studio subscriptions
When your organization purchases Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise, the Visual Studio portion of the subscriptions is provisioned immediately, and the subscriptions are available for assignment and management in the Visual Studio [Subscriptions Administration](https://manage.visualstudio.com) portal. After you assign a Visual Studio with GitHub subscription, the subscriber will receive an email letting them know they can access their Visual Studio subscription at <https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions>.

For more information about managing Visual Studio subscriptions, check out these topics:
- [Using the Admin Portal](using-admin-portal.md)
- [Assign Subscriptions](assign-license.md)
- [Edit Subscriptions](edit-license.md)
- [Delete Subscriptions](delete-license.md)
- [Overallocations](handle-overclaimed-license.md)

> [!Important]
> If Visual Studio Subscriptions with GitHub Enterprise are assigned by Visual Studio subscription admins without purchasing first, GitHub will not be notified that you wish to create a GitHub Enterprise account.  **A purchase of at least one** Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscription should be made before subscriptions are assigned.

## What is the Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise setup process?
GitHub Enterprise is set up and managed separately from Visual Studio subscriptions. Following a Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise purchase, a GitHub Enterprise account setup process is initiated in parallel with (but separate from) establishing an agreement in [manage.visualstudio.com](https://manage.visualstudio.com). Establishing this GitHub Enterprise account may take some time. 

After your company has set up a GitHub Enterprise account, subscribers who have been assigned Visual Studio with GitHub Enterprise subscriptions will receive an email from GitHub notifying them that their Visual Studio subscriptions have been linked. After subscribers receive this email, they can reach out to their GitHub organization administrator to receive an invitation to the appropriate organization.

For additional details on GitHub Enterprise setup, please reference the [subscriber documentation](access-github.md).   

## Manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions
When GitHub Enterprise subscriptions are purchased, GitHub partners with customers to help create and configure the organizations that will access GitHub and identify administrators.  Those administrators then receive a notification that they've been set up as admins.  

Since this process is more complex, it may take several days after subscriptions are purchased for the organizations and admins to be fully set up.

GitHub is available as either the cloud-based GitHub.com, or on-premise GitHub Enterprise Server.  The processes for managing the two versions differ.  GitHub provides a variety of help topics and administrator guides to help you manage GitHub Enterprise subscriptions.  We've provided links to selected topics below.

# Visual Studio Installer Projects Extension and .NET Core 3.1

Packaging applications as an MSI is often accomplished using the Visual Studio Installer Projects Extension.

You can download the extension here:
[Visual Studio Installer Projects](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioClient.MicrosoftVisualStudio2017InstallerProjects)

## Update for .NET Core
.NET Core has two different models for publishing.

- Framework-dependent deployments

- Self-contained applications include the runtime.

To learn more about these deployment strategies, see [.NET Core application publishing overview](/dotnet/core/deploying/).

### Workflow changes for .NET Core 3.1

1. Select **Publish Items** instead of **Primary Output** to get the correct output for .NET Core 3.1 projects.  To bring up this dialog, select **Add** > **Project Output...** from the project's context menu.

    ![The Publish Items output group in the Add Project Output Group dialog](../deployment/media/installer-projects-net-core-publish-items-output.png "Pick Publish Items")

2. To create a self-contained installer, set the **PublishProfilePath** property on the **Publish Items** node in the setup project, using the relative path of a publish profile with the correct properties set.

### Prerequisites for .NET Core 3.1

If you would like your installer to be able to install the necessary runtime for a framework-dependent .NET Core 3.1 app, you can do this using [prerequisites](../deployment/application-deployment-prerequisites.md).  From the properties dialog of your installer project, open the **Prerequisites...** dialog and you'll see the following entries:

![.NET Core items in the Prerequisites dialog](../deployment/media/installer-projects-net-core-prerequisites.png ".NET Core Prerequisites")

The **.NET Core Runtime...** option should be selected for console applications, **.NET Desktop Runtime...** should be selected for WPF/WinForms applications.

>[!NOTE]
>These items are present starting with the Visual Studio 2019 Update 7 release.
